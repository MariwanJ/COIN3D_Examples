A Collection of 3D drawing example in the Pivy/COIN3D World. 
Great examples that will help you to decrease the learning curve. Long time I tried to find these kind of examples.. no one could hlep me .. Google helped me !!

The origional examples could be found here : 
https://github.com/coin3d/pivy/tree/master/examples/Mentor

But this rep tries to modify them so you can run them as macro or inside FreeCAD console.
Liciens is not mentioned, it is the origional liciens.

I hope you enjoy lerning COIN3D in FreeCAD.
