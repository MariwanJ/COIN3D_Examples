# COIN3D / PIVY Examples/Macros for FreeCAD:
** A Collection of 3D drawing example in the Pivy/COIN3D World. 
### AIME:
I always wanted to see some examples for the Coin3d API. Looking at the documentation you get some times some lines of the script used in COIN3D or some cpp code which doesn't show you valuable examples.

Great examples that will help you to decrease the learning curve regarding this library. Long time I tried to find these kind of examples.. no one could hlep me .. Google helped me!! but not directly ... after many monthes searching .. 

The origional examples could be found here : 
https://github.com/coin3d/pivy/tree/master/examples/Mentor

But this reppository tried to modify them so you can run them as a macro or inside the FreeCAD console.
Liciens is not mentioned, it is the origional liciens.

I hope you enjoy lerning COIN3D in FreeCAD.

### Some limitation:
- There are files that cannot be modified to a suitable python file for FreeCAD. Due to the nature of the commands inside these files .. For example it has a specific Linux commands, or it has OpenGL library that is not existing in FreeCAD.
- Be aware that there are some files loaded form your HDD (*.iv) extentions. These files are with hardcoded path. You need to change them .. Don't forget. There is alwasy a TODO: FIXME: text near to that line
